# Portfolio-Project

## Description

The name is self-explanatory, but it's meant to be my portfolio. I started making it as part of a challenge in my web development course, but I expanded it further so it could be a portfolio I could use as well. The challenge had a set of objectives I had to complete. These were:

- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on your computer
- Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages
- (Optional) Buy a custom domain name and have it point to your GitHub Pages website

Along with these, the course also had a set of tasks to complete as I designed the page. Some of them were "Creating a wireframe," "Building a contact page," "Making the page responsive," between others.
